h2. Rescue From Templates Exceptions

You probably noticed that very useful little ActionController feature called "rescue_from":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Rescuable/ClassMethods.html#M000978 doesn't work for any exceptions that were thrown in your views. This is really bad, because you never know when an exception may occur.

The reason is that all views exception are always of the class ActionController::TemplateError. That obscure TemplateError wrap the real exception class and therefore make it invisible for your rescue_from handlers.

With that little plugin you can make exceptions that were thrown in the views visible for rescue_from handlers and therefore catch them correctly.

h2. Installation

Simply create a new initializer and put next code into it:

<pre><code>ActionController::Base.rescue_from_templates_exceptions = true
</code></pre>

That's all. Now you can continue writing regular rescue_from handlers without worrying that they won't work for exceptions that came from your views. Plug and play :)
