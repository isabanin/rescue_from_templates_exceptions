Rescue From Templates Exceptions
=============================

You probably noticed that very useful little ActionController feature called "rescue_from" doesn't work for any exceptions that were thrown in your views. This is really bad, because you never know when an exception may occur.

The reason is that all views exception are always of the class ActionController::TemplateError. That obscure TemplateError wrap the real exception class and therefore make it invisible for your "rescue_from" handlers.

With that little plugin you can make exceptions that were thrown in the views visible for "rescue_from" handlers and therefore catch them correctly.

Installation
============

Simply create a new initializer and put next code into it:

<pre><code>
ActionController::Base.rescue_from_templates_exceptions = true
</code></pre>

That's all.
